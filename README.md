# CSS-225-Week4-Debugging
This repository contains corrected versions of six Python programs for the Module 4 Lab Activity:
- time.py
- pirate.py
- collections.py
- branching.py
- grading.py
- time2.py

Each file was debugged to fix syntax errors, variable issues, and logic problems. Comments are included to explain the changes. This lab helped reinforce key debugging strategies and Python fundamentals.
